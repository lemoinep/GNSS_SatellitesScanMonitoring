This project provides a set of Python tools for scanning, monitoring, and analyzing GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) satellite signals. The programs enable real-time detection and tracking of multiple satellite constellations, collection of signal quality and status data, and visualization of satellite positions and signal metrics. These tools support monitoring GNSS performance, detecting anomalies or signal disruptions, and assisting in research or development related to satellite navigation and positioning systems.

Python Program Descriptions

- GNSS_SatellitesScanMonitoringLevel1.py: This script provides a foundational GNSS satellite scanning and monitoring system. It detects visible satellites from multiple GNSS constellations, measures their signal strengths, and continuously updates satellite status in real time. It is designed for basic monitoring tasks such as tracking satellite availability and signal quality, making it suitable for initial GNSS performance assessments.

- GPS_Yocto_Basis.py: This program interfaces directly with Yoctopuce GPS hardware modules to acquire raw GPS data streams. It processes satellite signals to extract accurate positioning, velocity, and timing information. The script serves as a hardware integration layer, enabling seamless communication with GPS devices and providing essential GPS data for further analysis or monitoring applications.

- GNSS_SatellitesScanMonitoringLevel2.py: This program connects to a GPS receiver (Yocto-GPS or system GPS) and determines the user's current geographic position. It retrieves and parses satellite data to calculate the elevation and azimuth of each visible satellite. For each satellite, it estimates its approximate latitude, longitude, and altitude in space. The program can display this information in the console and, with the 3D option, shows the satellites' positions on an interactive celestial sphere. Cardinal points and satellite names are visualized, and the user can rotate the sky map with the mouse.

- GNSS_SatellitesScanMonitoringLevel3.py: This program connects to a GPS receiver (Yocto-GPS or a system GPS) to determine the user's current geographic position and altitude. It retrieves and parses satellite data to calculate the elevation and azimuth of each visible satellite. For each satellite, the program estimates its approximate latitude, longitude, and altitude in space using geometric calculations. It displays detailed information for each satellite, including signal strength and whether it is used in the current position fix. The program supports both Yocto-GPS modules and standard serial GPS receivers, adapting its data parsing accordingly.

Future development will allow selecting one of the satellites and communicating with it. However, to achieve this, I need to conduct a state-of-the-art review on the subject to determine its feasibility. I will soon upload this review to my repository. I am doing this out of curiosity and to create effective tools that could be useful for my future software development projects.
